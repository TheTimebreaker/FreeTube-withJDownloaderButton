This is my fork of FreeTube, an open source desktop YouTube player built with privacy in mind.
For more info on this program, see [their main GitHub page](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube)!

<hr>

## Feature(s) of this fork
* A button on video pages, that sends the video URL directly to your locally installed JDownloader2. This allows you to easily download videos without having to copy / paste the URLs.

## How to compile / use
[This page of the original documentation](https://docs.freetubeapp.io/development/building-from-source) explains how to compile from source yourself.
If you do not wish to compile yourself, you can grab the latest release of this fork from [here](https://github.com/TheTimebreaker/FreeTube-withJDownloaderButton/releases/latest)

## Contribution
Since this fork mainly exists because I want this button and for no other purpose, <i>don't contribute here</i>. If you want to make FreeTube better, contribute on their codebase. The changes will inevitably end up here.
